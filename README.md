# Rainfall_Prediction

## Description


## Introduction and Motivation behind the Project
* Many researchers have focused on rainfall forecasting over the years. Rainfall prediction is one of the most critical aspects of economic growth in a country like India, where agriculture is one of the most important sectors. According to a study (Shah et al., 2018), precipitation forecasting is one of the most important investigations in meteorological science. Because of the existence of non-linearity and instabilities in the environment, it is difficult to forecast the Indian monsoon, which leads to the use of various machine learning models to solve the problem (Dash et al., 2018). Hence, this project focuses on identifying the most important factor responsible for rainfall and using the best machine learning model with highest accuracy for rainfall prediction.
